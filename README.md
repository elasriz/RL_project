# Reinforcement Learning for Robots Locomotion Learning

Killian SUSINI - Zakariae EL ASRI


## Summary

In this project, we provide the details of implementing a reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm for controlling a multi-legged robot. In particular, we describe the implementation of TD3 (twin-delayed deep deterministic policy gradient) concept to train a Walker-2D to move across a line. In the process, we used OpenAI/Gym environments and Pytorch utilities.

## Installation

To install the dependencies use pip and the requirements.txt in this directory. e.g.

```
    $ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## How to Run

To run the model interactively, run ``mesa runserver`` in this directory. e.g.

```
    $ mesa runserver
```

Then open your browser to [http://127.0.0.1:8521/](http://127.0.0.1:8521/) and press Reset, then Run.

## Files

* ``prey_predator/random_walker.py``: This defines the ``RandomWalker`` agent, which implements the behavior of moving randomly across a grid, one cell at a time. Both the Wolf and Sheep agents will inherit from it.
* ``prey_predator/agents.py``: Defines the Wolf, Sheep, and GrassPatch agent classes.
* ``prey_predator/schedule.py``: Defines a custom variant on the RandomActivation scheduler, where all agents of one class are activated (in random order) before the next class goes -- e.g. all the wolves go, then all the sheep, then all the grass.
* ``prey_predator/model.py``: Defines the Prey-Predator model itself
* ``prey_predator/server.py``: Sets up the interactive visualization server
* ``run.py``: Launches a model visualization server.
